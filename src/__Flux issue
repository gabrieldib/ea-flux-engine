    query if it is FLUX or NOT



1) we need data that starts from the original seq data (input by the user)

2) if flux is on, we transform this data and store into the flux table
    when? when playing, at each new group of blocks cycle 

3) because we have the dynamic slider either original or flux data needs to
be updated according to the dynamic slider value
    when is the data updated by the slider value?
        for the original data, only when the dyn slider value is changed
        using function 
            fn032_set_seq_step_value_and_ui_via_dyn_slider ()

        for the flux data
        - when the dyn slider changes (WIP)
        - when the flux values are created!      



    where does the dynamic transformed data land?
        into the SEQ.data.dyn table
            so this means that no matter if the data is original or fluxed
            the data in the SEQ.data.dyn is the one that was transformed 
            by the dynamic slider and is ready to be used for playing
