    DUAL:
        one of the sides is single shot, or both 
            if the left side is a single shot,
            when we go to JOIN SEQ, we need to:
                - turn on the seq on left side 

    When changing to SEQ JOIN:
        - turn on the seq on left side 
        - if no target is ON, update the label to show that


}

1) update the off label for targets when going to the SEQ JOIN
2) update the off label for targets when going to the SEQ DUAL ( currently wrong )


DONE:

LFO amount on volume while in crossfade mode
is changing the amount of both sides, it shouldn't
